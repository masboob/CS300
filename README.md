1. The primary goal was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how different data structures function and perform under different circumstances. This involved implementing distinct algorithms for each data structure and conducting a thorough analysis of their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
2. When approaching problems, it was important to undestand what I was looking to solve. After understanding what needs to be solved exactly, I would know which type of data structure that would be most sufficient. Understanding data structures is important in solving problems because it allows for efficient and effective manipulation of data.
3. While progressing through the activities, I faced a challenge in comprehending the intricacies of different data structures and their implementation specifics. However, I successfully overcame this obstacle by revisiting my class notes and conducting thorough research utilizing online resources.
4. Engaging in these projects has broadened my perspective on software design and program development by emphasizing the significance of comprehending data structures and algorithms.
5. Through my involvement in these projects, my programming practices have undergone significant development. I now prioritize writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs by reinforcing the significance of modular design, employing clear and concise code, and incorporating comprehensive commenting.
